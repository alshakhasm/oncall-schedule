# Feature Specification: Leaves Rendered as In-Cell Pills

**Feature Branch**: `[013-created-leaves-to]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "created leaves to shown as pills inside cells"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors (scheduler users), actions (view leaves in calendar), data (leave ranges), constraints (clarify overlap behavior)
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., who can see leaves), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a scheduler, I want staff leaves to be shown directly inside calendar cells as small pills so that I can immediately see unavailable days while planning on-call assignments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a staff member with a leave from a single day, when viewing that day in the calendar, then a leave pill appears in the cell with a clear visual indicator and label.
2. Given a contiguous multi-day leave within one week row, when viewing the week, then a connected pill spans the covered days and is not duplicated by separate per-day pills.
3. Given a multi-week leave, when viewing it across week boundaries, then separate spanning pills render per affected week row and in-cell pills are suppressed for covered days in those rows.
4. Given overlapping leave and on-call assignment for the same day, when viewing the day, then both statuses are visually represented without ambiguity [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: priority, stacking, or combined indicator?].
5. Given leaves for multiple staff, when viewing the calendar, then the leaves are distinguishable by label and/or color and accessible labels convey the staff and date range.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a leave starts/ends outside the visible range? The pill should be clipped to the visible portion.
- How should the UI display partial-week leaves that start mid-week and continue to next week? Render separate connected pills per week row.
- What if multiple leaves overlap on the same day (same or different staff)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: stacking order and maximum visible pills].
- How to handle zero-length or invalid ranges? The UI should not render pills for invalid ranges and should surface an error upstream.

### Visual & Interaction (recommended)
- Leave pills are visually distinct from assignment pills while still compact.  
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact color/style differences and legend update]
- Pills have keyboard focus and expose accessible names including staff and date range.
- Tooltip or inspector should show full details on focus/hover.

## Grid UI: Connected Multi-day Pills & In-Cell Pills (UI specification)

### Summary
Extend the existing grid pill system to support leave visualization similar to on-call assignments: render single-day in-cell pills and connected multi-day spanning pills, without duplicate per-cell pills where a spanning pill covers days.

### Goals
- Make staff unavailability obvious at a glance to avoid scheduling conflicts.
- Preserve compactness in multi-month views while keeping leaves legible.
- Maintain accessibility and keyboard navigation parity with assignment pills.

### Visual & Interaction Requirements
- **LEAVE-001**: Single-day leaves MUST render as an in-cell pill with a leave-specific style and a short label (e.g., staff initials or "Leave").
- **LEAVE-002**: Contiguous leave days within the same week row MUST render as a connected spanning pill in the overlay grid; suppress per-day pills underneath.
- **LEAVE-003**: Spanning leave pills MUST align to calendar grid columns and clip to the current week row; cross-row spans render as separate pills.
- **LEAVE-004**: In compact 3- and 6-month views, leave pill size and label truncate to fit; contrast remains acceptable.
- **LEAVE-005**: Leave and on-call pills MUST remain distinguishable in the same cell/week row [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: priority/stack order].
- **LEAVE-006**: Keyboard focus and accessible labels MUST include "Leave", staff name/initials, and date(s).

### Interaction Requirements
- **LEAVE-INT-001**: Opening the day inspector or details panel MUST list any leaves covering the selected date.
- **LEAVE-INT-002**: If drag-and-drop or editor allows creating leaves, the resulting pills MUST follow the same visual rules.  
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is creation of leaves in-scope for this feature or read-only visualization only?]

### Acceptance Criteria
- A leave from Sep 10‚Äì12 shows a single spanning pill across those three dates within the week row and no in-cell duplicates.
- In compact views, the leave pill renders at reduced height and font-size but stays readable and clipped to week rows.
- Screen reader users can navigate to pills and hear staff and date range.

### Files / Components Affected
- `src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx` ‚Äî add leave pill rendering to the overlay/in-cell system and integrate with week ownership logic.
- `src/styles.css` ‚Äî introduce leave-specific styles consistent with existing pill components.
- `src/components/*.test.tsx` ‚Äî new tests for leave rendering (single and spanning), duplication suppression, and compact modes.

### Notes / Clarifications
- Leaves do not change the underlying assignment data; rendering is visual.
- Overlap resolution with on-call pills may require a stacking policy or z-order.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-LEAVE-001**: The system MUST display leaves as pills inside calendar cells aligned with the corresponding dates.
- **FR-LEAVE-002**: The system MUST connect contiguous multi-day leaves within a week row as a single spanning pill.
- **FR-LEAVE-003**: The system MUST suppress per-cell leave pills where a spanning pill covers those days.
- **FR-LEAVE-004**: The system MUST ensure leaves are distinguishable from on-call assignments [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: styling specifics].
- **FR-LEAVE-005**: The system MUST provide accessible names on leave pills that include staff name/initials and date range.
- **FR-LEAVE-006**: The system SHOULD clip pills to visible dates when a leave extends beyond the current view.

### Visual & Interaction Requirements
- **FR-LEAVE-VIS-001**: Each leave pill MUST maintain readable contrast and a compact footprint in compact views.
- **FR-LEAVE-VIS-002**: A legend or roster SHOULD indicate how leaves are styled so users can distinguish them at a glance.
- **FR-LEAVE-VIS-003**: Leave pills MUST not interfere with drag-and-drop interactions for assignments.

### Key Entities
- **Leave**: A range with `staff`, `start date`, `end date`, optional `reason/notes` [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: attributes beyond date range].
